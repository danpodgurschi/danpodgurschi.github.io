                <img src="Minecraft.jpg" id="Minecraft"><p id="ConsoleGamesParagraph">The first, and one of the most popular games known, is Minecraft. As many people know, Minecraft is a first-person sandbox game that has 2 different modes: creative and survival. Survival mode starts you off with nothing in an infinite world, leaving you to find materials and food in order to stay alive. At night, creatures can come out and attack you, such as zombies or spiders. Creative mode gives you more breathing space. You can fly, build peacefully, and spawn animals. Basically, you're the god of that world. Platforms: PC, Xbox, PlayStation, mobile.</p>

It's probably not even appropriate for adults, but you can't say it's not action packed, no matter what you do! In GTA, you get rewarded for breaking the law, instead of following it. You can run over people, buy guns, or pretty much do anything that's illegal. However, you have to watch out; once you've commited enough crimes, the police will start coming for you.</p>
